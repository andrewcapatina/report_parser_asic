floorplan slide:

This is our layout shown with the different power domains. This is the first floorplan option and in our 
report we compare the setup times. This floorplan had better timing than our second option.

Place and Route:

Here is our layout with routes shown. All looks well however for some reason the supply nets from VDD
ports are not routed. We compared this to fifo design and VDD wasn't routed as well. We can use the get_net
command to get the supply nets, but for some reason they just aren't present in the layout. 

Level Shifter Presence:

Here are the level shifters. One thing i noticed was DC shell reported 4 level shifters, and in ICC2 I only
see 3 level shifters. I am unsure how one level shifter is missing. I don't think ICC2 would optimize this.


Isolation Cell Presence:

Here are the ISOs shown for both DC and ICC2. I also noticed here that we had 18 ISOs in DC, but 16
are only present in the layout.

Power Switch Presence:
	
Here are the power switches shown in DC and ICC2. I can use get_nets command to confirm the supply network 
structure as seen in the DC UPF diagram. however, for some reason the nets aren't physically implemented.
ICC2 recognizes the nets, but they are not physically implemented.


QuestaSim Verification:

I ran the simulation in power aware mode meaning that power intent is applied to the design.
So the simulation is able to read the UPF file and is able to model the power management system in siimulation.

To test the design I tested the outputs of the isolation cells. My first test was to set the isolation cells.
Second test was to observe X propagation when the isolation enable is not active. 

As shown by the waveforms, I am able to observe the isolation cell output being set. And I am also able to see
the X propagation. 

(Why do I need to observe X propagation?)
